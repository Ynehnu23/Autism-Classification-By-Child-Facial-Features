# Autism-Classification-By-Child-Facial-Features
**1. **General introduction:****

- The project "_**Identifying and Predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children**_" is the research and application of advanced methods in image processing and machine learning to make predictions to classify children with autism. the possibility of having ASD syndrome or not.
- This project aims to create a tool to support the assessment of children's mental health status, especially in early detection of signs of ASD syndrome. By integrating techniques such as deep learning models and image analysis methods, the project hopes to contribute to improving early diagnosis and intervention for people with ASD.

**2. Reason for choosing topic:**

- Patients with ASD have deficits in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal social communication skills, and intellectual and motor function. Causes of autism in children
- Genetics Many people believe that genes greatly influence the risk of autism. Faulty genes can make people more susceptible to autism if other factors are at play, such as chemical imbalances, viruses or chemicals, or lack of oxygen at birth.
- Due to pregnancy If during pregnancy, the mother is regularly exposed to toxic substances such as cigarettes, alcohol, drugs; Rubella virus infection; Thyroid disease causing tyrosine deficiency is also the cause of autism in children. In addition, factors from the external environment such as air pollution, dirty food, herbicides, etc. also increase the risk of children developing autism.
- Family attention During the child's development, if the family pays little attention, teaches and talks to the child, it also increases the risk of disease. Or families often have conflicts, quarrels, and conflicts that also greatly affect children's psychology and brain development. Family is the environment where children have the most contact, stimulating the child's development in all aspects, especially language and awareness skills about the child's surrounding environment and their unique needs.

- According to current research conducted by systematic review and meta-analysis from 2008 to July 2021. Databases such as **_Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, SID, Magiran, Web of Science (WoS ) and Google Scholar from 2008 to July 2021 were searched for relevant studies Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 2)._**
- Results: A total of 74 studies with 30,212,757 participants were included in this study. The worldwide prevalence of ASD is 0.6% (95% confidence interval: 0.4–1%). Subgroup analyzes indicated that the prevalence of ASD in Asia, America, Europe, Africa, and Australia was **_0.4% (95% CI: 0.1–1), 1% (95% CI: 0.1–1). 0.8–1.1), 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2–1), 1% (95% CI: 0.3–3.1), 1.7% (95% CI: 0.5–6.1) respectively.

- Autistic people's abilities and needs vary widely and may develop over time. While some people with autism can live independently, others have severe disabilities and require lifelong care and support. Autism often has an impact on educational and employment opportunities. Additionally, the need for families to provide care and support can be great. Societal attitudes and the level of support from local and national authorities are important factors that determine the quality of life of people with autism.

**3. **Objectives and meaning of the project:****

- Learn and apply machine learning and deep learning methods to create a highly accurate classification model to predict the likelihood of having ASD syndrome using facial images.
- Proving that facial proportions can reflect autism in children.
- Create the best possible model to detect and predict autism in children.
- Contribute to prediction for timely detection, intervention and timely treatment measures, providing opportunities for appropriate care and education methods for early support to improve quality of life. of children with ASD.
